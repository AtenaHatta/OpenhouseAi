Before starting the coding process, I conducted a comprehensive design planning. This approach allowed us to consider the layout from the user's perspective, making the coding process smoother and more efficient.

<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>-Server Performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced server performance by adopting Server-Side Rendering, taking into account the LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) score.</li>
<li>By converting all images to the WebP format, I optimized server performance.</li>
<li>Utilizing Next.js 14 further enables robust performance.</li>
</ul>

<h4>-User experience</h4>
<ul>
<li>focused on creating a user-engaging design by being mindful of button placements and color contrast.</li>
<li>This design is responsive to variable screen sizes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>-Code</h4>
<ul>
<li>By creating components for frequently used styles like buttons and chips, I achieved a reduction in code repetition.</li>
<li>By using Prettier and ESLint, I focused on enhancing the readability of styling with Tailwind and maintaining clean code.</li>
</ul>

<h4>-SEO</h4>
<ul>
<li>Setted metadata for each page, customizing the title and description according to the content of each page. </li>
<li>By adding alt attributes to buttons and images,I also focused on SEO optimization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Improve the quality of this application</h2>
If I have time, I would like to update some of the applications I have created, so I have summarized them below.
<h4>-Broken links</h4>
<p>In the API data, there are instances where image URLs are included, but they sometimes lead to broken links. In these cases, displaying a 'no data' image on the website improved the user experience</p>

<h4>-A range bar</h4>
<p>By creating a range bar that allows users to display data for the amount money they want to search for, and enabling area searches, the website becomes more user-friendly and easier to navigate</p>

<h4>-Skeloton layout</h4>
<p>Implemented a skeleton layout using Shedcn, and I aim to design the layout to resemble the data, as well as enable the insertion of the skeleton on all pages where data is being fetched.</p>

<h4>-Integrating Google Maps</h4>
<p>By integrating Google Maps and displaying property locations on the map, the website becomes more user-friendly. This approach is likely to prevent users from dropping off the website</p>
